I worked on the development of a Pirate Intelligent Agent, which applies Deep Q-learning to navigate around in a maze in search of a hidden treasure. The base source code provided already laid the groundwork with the following: it set up the basic environment of the game, viz., the maze structure in TreasureMaze.py, the dynamics of the game in GameExperience.py, and the base functions for the agent's movements and actions were in place. I thus implemented such with the deep Q-learning algorithm in my code. It consisted of developing logic for a training loop, experience replay, neural network updates for Q-values, and balancing between exploration and exploitation to enhance the agent's learning process.

Computer scientists are professional individuals most often involved in computational thinking with an objective of solving complicated issues, designing algorithms, developing software, and optimizing systems in such areas as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and software engineering. They go about these with the use of their work in information and communication technologies  in a way that their works drive the changes in technology towards getting better efficiencies and better relevance in the solution of real problems that have an impact on our daily lives. For illustration, this project involves building an AI agent in a maze to find a path, indicating how algorithms and learning techniques are designed to solve, from an informatics perspective, navigational issues that could have effects on the implementation of robotic and autonomous vehicles.


As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves several steps:

Problem Understanding: Clearly formulate the problem, including all of its requirements and constraints.
Design a Solution: Procedurally come up with an algorithm/model that would resolve this problem. In this and future projects, the deep Q-learning model is expected to be used by the agent in order to learn an optimal path in a maze.
Implement Solution: This involves translating a design into efficient, scalable code by picking the right set of data structures, algorithms, and programming paradigms.
Testing and Iteration: Thorough testing of this solution and constant reiteration to identify bugs, ensuring the performance is optimized, and the requirements are met. Analyze and Refine: Check the efficacy of the solution, and refine further if needed.


A computer scientist has ethical responsibilities towards the safety, reliability, and respect for privacy of software to end users, which implies that it is extremely important to protect their data by providing transparent, unbiased solutions that will not hurt them. To the organization, it means delivering quality, maintainable code in line with the legal set standards and guidelines. For example, in this project, some of the ethical considerations could be that AI should not do anything harmful or misuse data intentionally in case user data is involved.

In so doing, through integrating all of these practices and duties, scientists in computing create secure, efficient, and ethical technologies guiding society.
